# Paper Trail

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory, the client directory, and the server directory

## Developer Workflow
1. Checkout to main locally and pull from main in remote repo
2. Checkout to new feature branch using the format `[first-name-initial][last-name-initial]--[feature-description]` (e.g. `bs--fix-navigation-bug`)
3. Once feature is implemented, push branch to remote repo (e.g. `git push --set-upstream origin bs--fix-navigation-bug`) and make a PR
4. Once PR is approved, merge PR to `main`
